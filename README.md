# Mediator Cards

The idea for the mediator cards was born during my CAS 'Mediation in Business, Work and the Public Sector' at the Institute of Law and Legal Practice at the University of St. Gallen. My goal was to be able to quickly recall what I had learned in a simple and practical way. The mediator cards offer a simple and practical way to recall methods and techniques as well as the mediation phases, if the appropriate methodological basics and knowledge are available. The method cards briefly describe general techniques and are not specific to mediation. 

The cards are intended as a memory aid and do not claim to be complete or correct.

My thanks go to Dr. Otmar Schneider (one of our two course instructors) for editing the cards and to Mr. Thomas Flucher for the feedback on my thesis. 


## Thesis: Use and benefits of mediation for IT services according to ITILv3

The insights and experiences from the mediation training at the HSG have moved me to write this thesis. The respect and dignity that mediation shows to people correspond to my attitude and values. I am of the opinion that mediation should have a firm place in IT services, but that there are currently only very few approaches to establish it in IT services.

With this thesis I would like to show interested persons the chances and possibilities of mediation in IT services and thus encourage them to develop a mediation offer.



## Mediator Cards

The method cards describe various techniques and methods that can be used in mediation such as reframing, partializing, pacing and leading, looping, reflective questions, resource questions, normalizing, and more.

## Mediation Phase Cards

The Phase Cards provide support for the six phases of mediation (Preparation/Introduction, Information and Issue Gathering, Needs and Interests Clarification, Creative Option Search, Assessment/Action, and Agreement/Conclusion). This over four steps, which I have divided into Initialization, Preparation, Implementation, and Follow-up. In addition, on the back of each phase card there are tips & tricks and a panic room with helpful suggestions if something in the mediation phase does not go as desired.

| Phase | Content |
| - | - |
|1|	Preparation/Introduction
|2|	Information/Topic collection
|3| Clarification of Needs/Interests
|4| Creative Options Search
|5| Evaluation/Negotiation
|6| Agreement/Conclusion
